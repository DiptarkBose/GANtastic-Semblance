This project generates absolutely new, never seen before, actual faces! Generative Adversarial Networks are a type of unsupervised learning where two neural networks compete against each other. This is commonly used to generate image data.

## How does this works?

As the name suggests, we pit two networks against each other, one tries to copy the features of real data, while the other network tries to distinguish the real from fake data.
I have used the CelebA dataset which contains thousands of images of celebrities from all over the world, to train the generator network.
